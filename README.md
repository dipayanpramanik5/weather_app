# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# External tools used for building this application 
1. Openweather API: https://openweathermap.org/ used for fetching weather information.
2. Tailwind CSS: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app is used for as css library for this project

# React best-pracices used in this project
1. Funcational Component.
2. React hooks(useState, useEffect) for functional component.
3. SpreadOperator.
4. Two way component binding by pasing data from parent component to child as well as child to parent.
5. Destructuring of array and object.

# Application features.
1. By default show current weather information of Kokata, India location and weather information default unit is celsius.
2. User can Search weather of any city using text field and then click search icon.
3. User can see weather of user location clicking on location icon.
4. User can change the weather informations Unit to celsius to  fahrenheit and vice versa.
5. User iwill see error message if they search using invalid city name.
6. Weather forecast for future days is the forecasted data of 11AM of the respective days and Forecast weather is the temparature of the specific time(11 AM) of particular day. Its not the max or min temaprature

# Documentation of the API used here in the application.
1. Current Weather: https://openweathermap.org/current.
2. 3 hour forecast 5 days: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
